// ============================================================
// Research Tree - resource forge (Phase 3)
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// A faction's research bench cap rises automatically with era, but
// can also be raised further by feeding COINS here. Copper, silver
// and gold coins are accepted, contributing their value in silver-
// equivalents (copper 0.1, silver 1, gold 4). One forge serves the
// whole faction (not tied to a single bench). No world scans: the
// silver-equivalent flows into the map metadata's per-faction forge
// progress, which accumulates across feedings.
